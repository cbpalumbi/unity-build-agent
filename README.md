My entry for the Google ADK Hackathon. Agent Development Kit (ADK) project. See a demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frQN-aOUpBk

Main file is multi_tool_agent/agent.py. The repo also includes a local copy of the google-adk repo so I could modify the built-in web interface to add UI for build notifications.
